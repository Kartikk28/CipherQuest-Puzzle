# Codebreaker: A Number Guessing Game

I made this basic C code in order to show my proficiency in this language. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like random number generation, loops, and conditionals. It is an interactive number-guessing game where the user receives hints to crack a randomly generated "secret code." The game also includes configurable difficulty levels to make it more engaging.
